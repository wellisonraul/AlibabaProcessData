The released traces contain the detailed runtime metrics of nearly twenty thousand microservices. They are collected from Alibaba production clusters of over ten thousand bare-metal nodes during twelve hours in 2021.

Due to the size of the database, we uploaded the zipped files to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YY19mZXZYQa0kxisdNG-fQgBE1HFxzzB/view?usp=sharing).
